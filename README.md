# Restaurant ordering app

Food delivery app

## Features
When a user clicks on a plus button, a new section appears that contains the items that they want to order with their prices and the total price. There is an option to remove each particular item from the order. Whey they click on the Complete order button, they are presented with the payment modal. They are required to enter their name, bank card and CVV. When the user completes the form and clicks Pay, a personalized thank you message appears and they can place a new order.
